\section{Illustrative example%: The impossibility of direct reverse engineering generated code
	}
\label{sec:motivation}

We consider a producer-consumer example developed using component-based engineering.
Fig. \ref{fig:cbseexample} (left) shows the component-based model of the example.
The \ttt{p} producer produces data items and sends to a first-in first-out passive communication channel instance \ttt{fifo}.
The latter stores data in order for the consumer to pull it.
The class diagram of \ttt{FIFO} is explored in Fig. \ref{fig:cbseexample} (right).
FIFO persists data items in a sized queue attribute, namely, \ttt{queue}.
The latter is associated with the number of currently stored items (\ttt{numberOfItems}), the capacity (\ttt{MAX\_SIZE}), and other attributes and operations used for validating incoming items and the status of the queue.

The producer's port with \ttt{IPush} as its required interface is connected to the port of FIFO with \ttt{IPush} as its provided interface so that the producer and FIFO can interact with each other through their respective port.
Because FIFO provides two interfaces, it implements these.

The behavior of \ttt{FIFO} is described by using a UML State Machine as in Fig. \ref{fig:fifostatemachine}.
The machine activates the \ttt{Idle} state as initial state.
The latter waits for an item to come to the \ttt{fifo} component (through the \ttt{pPush} port, for instance).
The item is then checked for its validity by using a \ttt{choice} pseudo state.
The \ttt{DataQueuing} state verifies the status of the queue to decide to either add the item to the queue or discard it.

In the next sections, this example will be used for illustrating how XSeparation works.

\section{Motivating example: The impossibility of direct reverse engineering generated code}
\label{sec:motivation}
Let's consider a collaboration scenario between software architects and programmers in developing an event-driven paradigm-based system \ttt{System}. The latter's behavior is described by using a USM as in Fig. \ref{fig:IllustrationExample1}.
This USM is artificial, and is extracted and customized from the origin in \cite{shuang_formalizing}.
This USM consists of some simple, composite, and pseudo states such as \ttt{choice}, \ttt{connection point expoint}, and \ttt{junction}.

	\caption{Codes generated from the state machine example in Fig. \ref{fig:IllustrationExample1} by using our tool (a) and Rhapsody (b), and their respective evolved versions} 
	\label{fig:generatedcode}
\end{figure*}

Although many tools have the ability to generate code from USMs, a few such as IBM Rhapsody \cite{ibm_rhapsody} and ours are able to deal with this example because generating code for pseudo states such as \ttt{expoint} and \ttt{history} is not as simple as states.
Fig, \ref{fig:generatedcode} (a) and (b) show the code segments generated for the transition outgoing from the state \ttt{S111} of the example by using our tool and Rhapsody, respectively.

In this scenario, we assume that, on one hand, programmers prefer to
use the more familiar textual programming language. 
On the other hand, software architects, working at higher levels
of abstraction, tend to favor the use of models, and therefore
prefer graphical languages for describing the high-level logic behavior by using modeling tools.
Assuming that, for some reasons, the USM should be evolved to the next version as in Fig. \ref{fig:IllustrationExample2}.


For simplification, we assume that no effects are associated with the transitions in the examples.
In Fig. \ref{fig:generatedcode} (a), the code segment checks whether the state \ttt{S111} is active (lines 2-3).
If so, the exit actions of \ttt{S111} and \ttt{S11} are executed sequentially (lines 4 and 6).
The sub-states of \ttt{S11} and \ttt{S1} also become inactive by setting the appropriate values to \ttt{STATE\_MAX} (lines 5 and 7).
The segment then evaluates \ttt{guard1} (lines 8 and 12) to dynamically select which transition outgoing from the choice \ttt{c1} should be taken into account.
If the transition \ttt{t4} is selected, the exit action of \ttt{S1} is called (line 13) and followed by the entry action (line 15) and the restoration of the previous active sub-state of \ttt{S2} (lines 16-26). 
If the other transition \ttt{t7} is taken, \ttt{S1} and \ttt{S3} are exited and entered (lines 9-11), respectively.

The generated code in Fig. \ref{fig:generatedcode} (b) for the evolved version of the example in Fig. \ref{fig:IllustrationExample2} differs from that of Fig. \ref{fig:generatedcode} (a) by the way the history of \ttt{S2} is restored.
Fig. \ref{fig:generatedcode} (b) executes a deep restoration in lines 14-32 if \ttt{guard} is evaluated as false.

It is worth noting that, the codes are generated following some patterns, which are not explicitly understandable for the programmers to capture the control flow of the USM associated with the code.
Hence, it is quite challenging to modify the topology of the USM at the code level. 
Even, if the programmers could understand and modify the code following the defined patterns, which require a very high discipline, it is still very difficult for RTE tools to decipher and reflect the code changes to the model.

Furthermore, different code generation patterns produce different code looks.
As a result, it is very hard, if not impossible, to find common rules to reconstruct the original state machine from the code. 
This is since existing tools such as Rhapshody supporting round-trip engineering have no way to recover the modified code to the original USM.

Consequently, to interfere the high-level logic behavior of the systems, the programmers must use the click-and-select mechanism of modeling tools, which are, as previously, not encouraged for the programmers to be efficient. 
Furthermore, using the heavy modeling tools, which are usually pricey, does not guarantee the seamless collaboration between the different practices of the programmers and software architects.  

In the next section, we show how RAOES can handle this collaboration problem.

\subsection{Problem definition and challenges}
\label{subsec:problemdefinition}
The system architecture is described by UML class and component diagrams and the behavior by UML State Machines.
These architecture and behavior models, briefly as the design model, are then used for generating code (implementation).
The code can be modified by programmers while in the meantime the architecture model might be modified by software architects.
The concurrent modifications raise the problem of consistency between the architecture model and implementation code.

Synchronization of concurrent modifications made in the architecture model and code is considered as a hard problem because of the abstraction gap between the architecture and the implementation (code). 
This gap makes the bidirectional traceability, which allows to reflect modifications made in one artifact to the other, between model and code hard, even impossible.

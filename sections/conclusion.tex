\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented an approach whose objective is to provide a complete, efficient, and UML-compliant code generation solution from UML State Machine. 
The design for concurrency of generated code is based on multi-thread.
The code generation pattern set extends the IF-ELSE/SWITCH patterns and the state pattern extension. 
The hierarchy of USM is kept by our simple state structure.

We evaluated our approach by implementing a prototype PSM and conducting experiments on the semantic-conformance and efficiency of generated code.
The former is tested under PSSM that 62/66 tests passed.
For efficiency, we used the benchmark defined by Boost to compare code generated by PSM to other approaches.
The results showed that PSM produces code that runs faster in even processing and is smaller in executable size than those of other approaches (in the paper scope).

However, code produced by PSM consumes slightly more memory than the others.
Furthermore, some PSSM tests are failed.
Therefore, as a future work, we will fix these issues by making multi-thread part of generated code more concise.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
This section presents our experiments with a case study of developing a software application for LEGO to evaluate the feasibility and usability of XSeparation.
The latter is implemented as an extension of the Papyrus modeling tool, which is based on Eclipse.
Architecture models in UML and XSeparation-generated C++ are synchronized.
Our XSeparation compiler supports POSIX systems, in which pthreads are used for executing concurrency specified in UML State Machines.
For incremental code generation in XSeparation, a model listener based on IncQuery is hooked to the modeling tool to detect model modifications.

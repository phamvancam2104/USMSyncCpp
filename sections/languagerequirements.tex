\subsection{Proposed Solution}
\label{subsec:langrequirement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The intermediate language has the ability to connect to the architecture model through a trivial mapping between the architecture and this language.
	We propose concepts closely mapped to the architecture concepts.
	
	\item A synchronization mechanism must be established between the architecture model and the intermediate language in case of concurrent synchronization. 
	We propose a synchronization mechanism.
	
	\item The intermediate language must be textual for programmers' perception, contain mechanisms and constructs to specify fine-grained statements, computational algorithms that can be done in OOPLs can be done, and must be similar to object-oriented languages so that programmers can easily use it.
	
\end{itemize}

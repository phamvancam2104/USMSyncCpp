Event-driven architecture is an useful way to design and solve the complexity of today systems.
Unified Modeling Language State Machine and its visualization are a powerful means to the modeling of the logical behavior of such architecture.   
Model Driven Engineering generates executable code from state machines. 
However, despite many useful UML State Machine concepts, the support of existing generation approaches is still limited to simple cases, especially when considering concurrency and pseudo states such as history, junction, and event types.

%In order to increase the use of MDE into software development, this 
This paper provides a complete and efficient code generation approach from UML State Machine. 
The proposal combines IF-ELSE-SWITCH constructions of programming languages and the state pattern with our support for concurrency. 
Our approach is tested under the Precise Semantics Of State Machine. Efficiently, even supporting multi-thread-based concurrency, binary files compiled from and the event processing speed of runtime execution of code generated by our approach are significantly improved when comparing to other approaches.

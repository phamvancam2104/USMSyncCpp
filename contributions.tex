\label{subsec:contribution}
In this paper, we propose \tb{XSeparation} - an extreme separation code generation approach, synchronization, and compilation, which enable the bidirectional traceability between software model, which consists of architecture and behavior models, and code.
XSeparation lifts the \ttt{deep separation} approach to an extreme level of separation.
XSeparation provides adequate support for programmers to control both architecture and state machine-based behavior of a component at the code level by making changes in generated architecture-prescribed and state machine-based behavior-prescribed code, respectively.
The changes are then reflected to the model through the bidirectional traceability to keep the model and the code consistent.

1. Introduction
	a. prb definition
	b. why is it a problem
	c. contribution
2. Approach in a nutshell
	Instead of synchronizing the architecture directly with the code, we propose to synchronize the model with an intermediate representation
	At which abstraction level for the intermediate representation? requirements for the representation?
3. Motivational example
4. Application of approach in C++ => RTE4COMP
5. A synchronization mechanism
6. Discussion: how the problem is solved?
(Experiments??)
7. Related work
	Archface: 
		-a contract description language between design and implementation ==> the focus is on design and code correctness verification
		-does not intend to implement full implementation 
		-Archface is aspect-oriented language with two interfaces: component and connector
	RTE4COMP:
		-An approach for tailoring the OOPLs
		-Used for full implementation by executable code generation 
		-Refining the semantics of a subset of OOPL contructs to contain architectural decision at the code level 
		-The focus is to allow concurrent development

abstract = {In aircrafts, densifying electrical systems and oversizing cables in order to respect constraints induce a useless increase in cable weight. This increase leads to additional costs of operation and to an unnecessary pollution during the plane operating life. In this paper we address optimization of harness weight which is a mono-objective problem with manifold and interdependent constraints. To solve this problem, we use a multi-agent approach based on the cooperative self-organization of agents. Performances obtained by the 'Smart Harness Optimizer' software that we have developed are promising for problems considered by the experts as being very difficult. In this article, we expose the method used to solve this Constraint Optimization Problem. Then we apply it to the addressed problem and finally we give results on typical cases and analyze them.}

abstract = {Abstract: This paper describes an automated process for designing mechanical systems based on the adaptive multi-agent system(AMAS)theory. At the beginning of the design process, the designer adds the elements of his problem: goal, envelope, constraints, known mechanical components, etc. During the solving process, mechanical components(previouslyÂ¿agentifiedÂ¿)organize themselves in order to find a solution, by modifying their parameters, by creating new mechanical components fitting in with the needs, or by modifying the system topology. While this paper presents an overview of the theoretical basis of the AMAS theory, it primarily focuses on the method for developing the mechanical synthesis solver and the results from this prototype. }

abstract = {A complex product is generally a system composed of numerous interdependent components, each one representing specific disciplines and developed using associated expertise. When analysing the problem from another point of view, we can see that for each design domain, a generally huge set of real already designed elements exists. Thus, then constructing a new element, it is interesting to use this already known and acquired knowledge. This knowledge does not only contain the discipline?s information but also the engineers? experience. Considering this point of view, the design of complex products defines a new generic class of complex problems. In this paper, we address this class of problems using the Self-Adaptive Population Based Reasoning (SAPBR) generic approach. It is based on the Adaptive Multi-Agent System (AMAS) theory that takes advantage from cooperation to design robust and open multi-agent systems. In SAPBR, agents use cooperative self-tuning principles in order to estimate and 
discover new characteristic values for the design of new elements. The obtained system is compared to the Self-Organising Map (SOM) and the Multilayer Perceptron (MP) algorithms that address similar problems.}

Our system named Dynamo is designed along this domain but following an original approach based on an adaptive multi-agent architecture. In this paper we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, core of our approach. It is evaluated and compared to a more conventional centralized algorithm. We also present how it has been improved using a multi-criteria approach. With those results in mind, we discuss the limits of our system and add as perspectives the modifications required to reach a complete ontology building solution.}

abstract ={A central challenge for cognitive and systems neuroscience is to relate the incredibly complex behavior of animals to the equally complex activity of their brains. Recently described, large-scale neural models have not bridged this gap between neural activity and biological function. In this work, we present a 2.5-million-neuron model of the brain (called Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpaunÃ¢â‚¬Â�) that bridges this gap by exhibiting many different behaviors. The model is presented only with visual image sequences, and it draws all of its responses with a physically modeled arm. Although simplified, the model captures many aspects of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and psychological behavior, which we demonstrate via eight diverse tasks.},

abstract={"Brian" is a new simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python (http://brian.di.ens.fr). It is an intuitive and highly flexible tool for rapidly developing new models, especially networks of single-compartment neurons. In addition to using standard types of neuron models, users can define models by writing arbitrary differential equations in ordinary mathematical notation. Python scientific libraries can also be used for defining models and analysing data. Vectorisation techniques allow efficient simulations despite the overheads of an interpreted language. Brian will be especially valuable for working on non-standard neuron models not easily covered by existing software, and as an alternative to using Matlab or C for simulations. With its easy and intuitive syntax, Brian is also very well suited for teaching computational neuroscience.}}

@article{Izhikevich2008,
    abstract = {The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-
dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic {STDP}). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.},

abstract ={Modeling work in neuroscience can be classified using two different criteria. The first one is the complexity of the model, ranging from simplified conceptual models that are amenable to mathematical analysis to detailed models that require simulations in order to understand their properties. The second criterion is that of direction of workflow, which can be from microscopic to macroscopic scales (bottom-up) or from behavioral target functions to properties of components (top-down). We review the interaction of theory and simulation using examples of top-down and bottom-up studies and point to some current developments in the fields of computational and theoretical neuroscience.},

    abstract = {<p>Temporally precise sequences of neuronal spikes that span hundreds of milliseconds are observed in many brain areas, including songbird premotor nucleus, cat visual cortex, and primary motor cortex. Synfire chainsâ€”networks in which groups of neurons are connected via excitatory synapses into a unidirectional chainâ€”are thought to underlie the generation of such sequences. It is unknown, however, how synfire chains can form in local neural circuits, especially for long chains. Here, we show through computer simulation that long synfire chains can develop through spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity and axon remodelingâ€”the pruning of prolific weak connections that follows the emergence of a finite number of strong connections. The formation process begins with a random network. A subset of neurons, called training neurons, intermittently receive superthreshold external input. Gradually, a synfire chain emerges through a recruiting process, in which neurons within the network connect to 
the tail of the chain started by the training neurons. The model is robust to varying parameters, as well as natural events like neuronal turnover and massive lesions. Our model suggests that long synfire chain can form during the development through self-organization, and axon remodeling, ubiquitous in developing neural circuits, is essential in the process.</p>},

  abstract={"Brian" is a new simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python (http://brian.di.ens.fr). It is an intuitive and highly flexible tool for rapidly developing new models, especially networks of single-compartment neurons. In addition to using standard types of neuron models, users can define models by writing arbitrary differential equations in ordinary mathematical notation. Python scientific libraries can also be used for defining models and analysing data. Vectorisation techniques allow efficient simulations despite the overheads of an interpreted language. Brian will be especially valuable for working on non-standard neuron models not easily covered by existing software, and as an alternative to using Matlab or C for simulations. With its easy and intuitive syntax, Brian is also very well suited for teaching computational neuroscience.}

In this paper we extend methods developed previously for controlling collective movements of agent teams to serve as the basis for self-assembly or  â€� growthâ€� of networks, using neural networks as a concrete application to evaluate our approach. Our central innovation is having network connections arise as persistent  â€� trailsâ€� left behind moving agents, trails that are reminiscent of pheromone deposits made by agents in ant colony optimization models. The resulting network connections are thus essentially a record of agent movements. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness by using it to produce two large networks that support subsequent learning of topographic and feature maps. Improvements produced by the incorporation of collective movements are also examined through computational 
experiments. These results indicate that methods for directing collective movements can be adopted to facilitate network self-assembly.},

We develop a mean-#eld method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-#eld method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling. c # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

  abstract={Agent Based Modeling (ABM) toolkits are as diverse as the community of people who use them. With so many toolkits available, the choice of which one is best suited for a project is left to word of mouth, past experiences in using particular toolkits and toolkit publicity. This is especially troublesome for projects that require specialization. Rather than using toolkits that are the most publicized but are designed for general projects, using this paper, one will be able to choose a toolkit that already exists and that may be built especially for one's particular domain and specialized needs. In this paper, we examine the entire continuum of agent based toolkits. We characterize each based on 5 important characteristics users consider when choosing a toolkit, and then we categorize the characteristics into user-friendly taxonomies that aid in rapid indexing and easy reference.},

    abstract = {Adaptive software is used in situations where either the environment is unpredictable or the system is open. This paper presents a methodology named ADELFE, which is led by the Rational Unified Process (RUP) but is devoted to software engineering of adaptive multi- agent systems. ADELFE guarantees that the software is developed according to the AMAS theory1. We focus this presentation on the additions of ADELFE regarding the three first core workflows of the RUP. Therefore, during the requirements phase, the environment of the studied system must be defined and characterized. Then, in the analysis phase, the engineer is guided to decide to use adaptive multi-agent technology and to identify the agents through the system and the environment models. Finally, the design workflow of ADELFE must provide the cooperative agent's model and helps the developer to define the local agents. behavior. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to a case study: a timetable design.},

This departure, its recent development and its increasing application by non-traditional simulation disciplines indicates the need to continuously assess the current state of ABM and identify opportunities for improvement. To begin to satisfy this need, we surveyed and collected data from 279 articles from 92 unique publication outlets in which the authors had constructed and analyzed an agent-based model. From this large data set we establish the current practice of ABM in terms of year of publication, field of study, simulation software used, purpose of the simulation, acceptable validation criteria, validation techniques and complete description of the simulation. Based on the current practice we discuss six improvements needed to advance ABM as an analysis tool. These improvements include the development of ABM specific tools that are independent of 
software, the development of ABM as an independent discipline with a common language that extends across domains, the establishment of expectations for ABM that match their intended purposes, the requirement of complete descriptions of the simulation so others can independently replicate the results, the requirement that all models be completely validated and the development and application of statistical and non-statistical validation techniques specifically for ABM.},

In this article, we report on the activity of the Working Group on Agents in Bioinformatics (BIOAGENTS) founded during the first AgentLink III Technical Forum meeting on the 2nd of July, 2004, in Rome. The meeting provided an opportunity for seeding collaborations between the agent and bioinformatics communities to develop a different (agent-based) approach of computational frameworks both for data analysis and management in bioinformatics and for systems modelling and simulation in computational and systems biology. The collaborations gave rise to applications and integrated tools that we summarize and discuss in context of the state of the art in this area. We investigate on future challenges and argue that the field should still be explored from many perspectives ranging from bio-conceptual languages for agent-based simulation, to the definition of bio-ontology-based declarative 
languages to be used by information agents, and to the adoption of agents for computational grids.},

    abstract = {Computational modeling of biological systems is becoming increasingly important in efforts to better understand complex biological behaviors. In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological modelsâ€”mathematical and computationalâ€”which differ in their representations of biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems 'executable biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research. This will drive biology toward a more precise engineering discipline.},

   abstract = {Traditional (i.e. analytical) modelling practices in the social sciences rely on a very well established, although implicit, methodological protocol, both with respect to the way models are presented and to the kinds of analysis that are performed. Unfortunately, computer-simulated models often lack such a reference to an accepted methodological standard. This is one of the main reasons for the scepticism among mainstream social scientists that results in low acceptance of papers with agent-based methodology in the top journals. We identify some methodological pitfalls that, according to us, are common in papers employing agent-based simulations, and propose appropriate solutions. We discuss each issue with reference to a general characterization of dynamic micro models, which encompasses both analytical and simulation models. In the way, we also clarify some confusing terminology. We then propose a three-stage process that could lead to the establishment of methodological standards in social 
and economic simulations.},

There are cases in which practical or ethical reasons make it impossible to realize direct observations: in these cases, the possibility of realizing 'in-machina' experiments may represent the only way to study, analyze and evaluate models of those realities. Different situations and systems are characterized by the presence of autonomous entities whose local behaviors (actions and interactions) determine the evolution of the overall system; agent-based models are particularly suited to support the definition of models of such systems, but also to support the design and implementation of simulators. Agent-Based models and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been adopted to simulate very different kinds of complex systems, from the simulation of socio-economic systems to the 
elaboration of scenarios for logistics optimization, from biological systems to urban planning. This paper discusses the specific aspects of this approach to modeling and simulation from the perspective of Informatics, describing the typical elements of an agent-based simulation model and the relevant research."

We furthermore consider that the neuron dynamics may occur at a (shorter) time scale than synaptic plasticity and consider the possibility of learning rules with passive forgetting. We show that the application of such Hebbian learning leads to drastic changes in the network dynamics and structure. In particular, the learning rule contracts the norm of the weight matrix and yields a rapid decay of the dynamics complexity and entropy. In other words, the network is rewired by Hebbian learning into a new synaptic structure that emerges with learning on the basis of the correlations that progressively build up between neurons. We also observe that, within this emerging structure, the strongest synapses organize as a small-world network. The second effect of the decay of the 
weight matrix spectral radius consists in a rapid contraction of the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix. This drives the system through the ``edge of chaos'' where sensitivity to the input pattern is maximal. Taken together, this scenario is remarkably predicted by theoretical arguments derived from dynamical systems and graph theory.",

We present an intracellular signalling model obtained by integrating several computational techniques into an agent-based paradigm. Cellulat, the model, takes into account two essential aspects of the intracellular signalling networks: (1) cognitive capacities, which are modelled as the agent abilities to interact with the surrounding medium and (2) a spatial organisation, this last obtained using a shared data structure through which the agents communicate between them.

The task of identifying biological function prediction for the DNA sequences is a key activity in genome projects. This task is done in the annotation phase, which is divided into automatic and manual. The automatic annotation has the objective of finding, for each DNA sequence identified in the project, similar sequences among millions, stored in public databases, by using approximated pattern matching algorithms. The manual annotation is done by the biologists, that use the results produced by the automatic annotation, and their knowledge and experience, to decide the function prediction to each DNA sequence. In this way, the biologists guarantee accuracy and correctness to each sequence function prediction. This work presents a new version of BioAgents, a multiagent system (MAS) for supporting manual annotation. The system simulates the biologistsâ€™ knowledge and 
experience for annotating DNA sequences in genome sequencing projects. The MAS cooperative approach, allows to create different specialized intelligent agents that, working together, suggest proper manual annotation. BioAgents was defined with a three-layer architecture using the JADE framework with a ruler-based engine (JESS). We have done experiments with real data from three different genome sequencing projects: Paracoccidioides brasilienses fungus, Paullinia cupana (guaran{\'a}) plant and Anaplasma marginale rickettsia.

@Article{ Railsback2006,
	abstract = "Five software platforms for scientific agent-based models (ABMs) were reviewed by implementing example models in each. NetLogo is the highest-level platform, providing a simple yet powerful programming language, built-in graphical interfaces, and comprehensive documentation. It is designed primarily for ABMs of mobile individuals with local interactions in a grid space, but not necessarily clumsy for others. NetLogo is highly recommended, even for prototyping complex models. MASON, Repast, and Swarm are ``framework and library'' platforms, providing a conceptual framework for organizing and designing ABMs and corresponding software libraries. MASON is least mature and designed with execution speed a high priority. The Objective-C version of Swarm is the most mature library platform and is stable and well organized. Objective-C seems more natural than Java for ABMs but weak error-handling and the lack of developer tools are drawbacks. Java Swarm allows Swarm's Objective-C libraries to be called 
from Java; it does not seem to combine the advantages of the two languages well. Repast provides Swarm-like functions in a Java library and is a good choice for many, but parts of its organization and design could be improved. A rough comparison of execution speed found MASON and Repast usually fastest (MASON 1-35\% faster than Repast), Swarm (including Objective-C) fastest for simple models but slowest for complex ones, and NetLogo intermediate. Recommendations include completing the documentation (for all platforms except NetLogo), strengthening conceptual frameworks, providing better tools for statistical output and automating simulation experiments, simplifying common tasks, and researching technologies for understanding how simulation results arise. 10.1177/0037549706073695",

	abstract = "Our understanding of the operation of the brain depends on knowledge of its wiring. Currently, the wiring of the human brain is estimated by counting the number of neuron discharges that occur at specific times following a stimulus. There is now strong evidence that this approach generates significant errors. Recently, the accuracy of this 'count' method has been compared directly with an alternative 'rate' method in rat brain slices. The results confirmed that the count method generates significant errors that are minimized by the rate method, because the rate of discharge of a neuron accurately displays its excitability at the time of discharge. Therefore, it is now crucial that the rate method be used to reassess previous estimates of the characteristics of wiring in the brain.",

	abstract = "The aim of this review is to discuss what is known about the reflex control of the human masticatory system and to propose a method for standardized investigation. Literature regarding the current knowledge of activation of jaw muscles, receptors involved in the feedback control, and reflex pathways is discussed. The reflexes are discussed under the headings of the stimulation conditions. This was deliberately done to remind the reader that under each stimulation condition, several receptor systems are activated, and that it is not yet possible to stimulate only one afferent system in isolation in human mastication experiments. To achieve a method for uniform investigation, we need to set a method for stimulation of the afferent pathway under study with minimal simultaneous activation of other receptor systems. This stimulation should also be done in an efficient and reproducible way. To substantiate our conviction to standardize the stimulus type and parameters, we discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages of mechanical and electrical stimuli. For mechanical stimulus to be delivered in a reproducible way, the following precautions are suggested: The stimulus delivery system (often a probe attached to a vibrator) should be brought into secure contact with the area of stimulation. To minimize the slack between the probe, the area to be stimulated should be taken up by the application of pre-load, and the delivered force should be recorded in series. Electrical stimulus has advantages in that it can be delivered in a reproducible way, though its physiological relevance can be questioned. It is also necessary to standardize the method for recording and analyzing the responses of the motoneurons to the stimulation. For that, a new technique is introduced, and its advantages over the currently used methods are discussed. The new method can illustrate the synaptic potential that is induced in the motoneurons without the errors that are unavoidable in the current techniques. We believe that once 
stimulation, recording, and analysis methods are standardized, it will be possible to bring out the real ``wiring diagram'' that operates in conscious human subjects.",

Describing this kind of phenomena with a visual language can facilitate the use of these tools by users who are not necessarily experts in computer programming, but in social sciences. With this purpose, we propose to define such visual language, which is based on well established concepts of agent-oriented software engineering, and more concretely on the INGENIAS methodology. The proposed language is independent of any particular simulation platform and, by using INGENIAS code generation support, it is possible to generate implementations for the desired target platforms. Also, we consider that modeling should be application domain oriented and that a generic language itself does not suffice. Thus, we discuss at the end how specific domain simulation environments could be achieved.",

@InCollection{ Calvez2006,
	abstract = "When developing multi-agent systems (MAS) or models in the context of agent-based simulation (ABS), the tuning of the model constitutes a crucial step of the design process. Indeed, agent-based models are generally characterized by lots of parameters, which together determine the global dynamics of the system. Moreover, small changes made to a single parameter sometimes lead to a radical modification of the dynamics of the whole system. The development and the parameter setting of an agent-based model can thus become long and tedious if we have no accurate, automatic and systematic strategy to explore this parameter space.",

@InProceedings{ Macal2005,
	abstract = "Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents. ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a third way of doing science besides deductive and inductive reasoning. Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few. This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of ABMS, identifies toolkits and methods for developing ABMS models, and provides some thoughts on the relationship between ABMS and traditional 
modeling techniques.",

Our framework allows us to build behavioural models for applications ranging from sequential Fractal components, to distributed objects, and finally distributed components. Our models are able to characterise both functional and non-functional behaviours, and the interaction between the two concerns. Finally, this work has resulted in the development of tools allowing the non-expert programmer to specify the behaviour of his components, and automatically, or semi-automatically verify properties of his application.}},
